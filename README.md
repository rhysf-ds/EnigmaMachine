# EnigmaMachine
Enigma machine written in python

Currently learning python and i've always had an interest in the enigma machine so as a weekend project i 
spent some timing putting together an enigma machine in python.

i have covered the most complex parts of the machine so far the rotos/reflectiona and path back through the machine and it now works as expected 
when encrypting and decrypting information. I used the following sources for information on the enigma machine and an emulator to test my outputs against:
