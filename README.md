# EnigmaMachine
Enigma machine written in python

Currently learning python and i've always had an interest in the enigma machine so as a weekend project i 
spent some timing putting together an enigma machine in python.

It's now mostly complete apart from the switchboard at the start but that is a relatively minor addition. Next steps are that i need to 
add comments into my code, format it within the pep guidelines, and see whether there's any more that can be converted into OOP format like 
i have done with some parts. Overall it has been a fun project and got me thinking a lot as i did my best to only get certain information from the internet like the actual configuration of the dials and leave the conceptual thinking and how to implement to my own creation. 

I'd like to also create a bombe decryptor and machine learning algorithm to interact with both which i'll look at in the future.

i have covered the most complex parts of the machine so far the rotos/reflectiona and path back through the machine and it now works as expected 
when encrypting and decrypting information. I used the following sources for information on the enigma machine and an emulator to test my outputs against:
